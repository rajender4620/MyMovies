MyMovies is a Flutter app that allows users to browse, search, and save movies. It fetches data from an animation movie API, displaying movie details like title, poster, and IMDb ID. The app supports offline functionality, saving favorite movies for quick access, and includes a responsive UI with state management using Bloc.
